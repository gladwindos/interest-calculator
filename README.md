## Run Instructions
I used the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to serve the "currency.json" file I created which is in the root folder.

To start the server, run:

```bash
$ json-server --watch db.json
```

To start the react app, cd into the src folder and run:

```bash
$ npm start
```
