## Run Instructions
I used [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to serve the "currency.json" file I created in the root folder.

To start the server, run:

```bash
$ json-server currency.json --port 8080
```

To start the react app, cd into the src folder and run:

```bash
$ npm start
```
